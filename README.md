# Interview Demo
Automation Demo for Interviewees

This automation framework is intended to be used for interviewees for PPL

The objective of this application is to write and code tests for a simple Cricket Over app such that I can manage one over of cricket. I expect any interviewee to leverage either JUnit or RestAssured to evaluate and verify the tests.

Should any questions occur, it is expected that the interviewee write these questions in the meeting channel provided so that we can provide feedback and clarification for the interviewee.

This demo is expected to last one hour.
